## Hi there! 👋

I'm Toran, a web dev enthusiast, football fan and gamer. I love myself a good animated show as well from time to time.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React in an advanced level, UI/UX design, backend development, AWS, frontend systems, modern rendering strategies, and anything that strikes my interest in https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a CRUD template that I can reuse for my upcomming e-commerce and Durarara-inspired chat apps, and a personal blog to share any learnings that the world needs to know about.

- 💬 Ask me about optimising web apps, offline-first apps, my favourite football team or a good animated show reccomendation - I'm especially a pro in the last one 

- 📖 I am currently reading:
  - Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
  - TCP/IP Illustrated by W. Richard Stevens
  - What Every Programmer should Know About Memory by Ulrich Drepper

I promise this markdown will look better later in the future!
